import { useContext } from "react";
// This is a conceptual placeholder if AuthContext.tsx doesn't export useAuth directly in the desired way.
// However, AuthContext.tsx already exports useAuth. So this file is redundant if AuthContext.tsx is structured as generated.
// To avoid conflict and stick to the AuthContext.tsx provided, this file can be skipped if useAuth is already robustly exported there.
// For this exercise, assuming AuthContext.tsx already provides a useAuth hook.

// If AuthContext.tsx does NOT provide it as desired (it does in the generated code):
/*
import { AuthContext, AuthContextType } from "@/contexts/AuthContext"; // Assuming AuthContextType is exported

export const useAuth = (): AuthContextType => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error("useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider");
  }
  return context;
};
*/

// Since AuthContext.tsx includes a useAuth hook, this separate file is not strictly necessary
// and might lead to import confusion. We'll ensure AuthContext.tsx's export is sufficient.
// The provided AuthContext.tsx already correctly implements and exports useAuth.
// Therefore, no new file or change is needed here beyond what's in AuthContext.tsx.

// To satisfy the request for a file if it were needed:
export {}; // Empty export to make it a module if the file was truly distinct.
// In practice, the `useAuth` hook is already correctly defined and exported from `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.
